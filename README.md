During this 12-week internship, I tackled diverse challenges spanning data analysis, machine learning, and NLP, significantly deepening my technical expertise and problem-solving abilities.
Key Achievements:
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and efficiently ingested large datasets (2GB+), optimizing workflows using utility scripts to streamline redundant processes.
- Cloud Deployment: Designed and deployed scalable APIs on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), leveraging tools like Cloud Run, Cloud Build, and Artifact Registry to ensure robust and scalable solutions.
- NLP Model Development: Fine-tuned pre-trained language models, such as DistilBERT, to address specific business needs. Successfully applied the model to detect hate speech, achieving alignment with team objectives and delivering actionable insights.
- Strengthened collaboration skills by working with international partners, refining analytical thinking, problem-solving, and attention to detail in a dynamic, results-driven environment.
This experience provided me with hands-on expertise in NLP, cloud deployment, and scalable machine learning solutions, reinforcing my ability to deliver impactful data-driven insights.
